The plan begins with walking around the room and carefully considering what exactly needs to be changed. It’s important to reflect on what works and what doesn’t, without rushing to get rid of things that are still nice or functional. The goal at this stage is to understand what could be improved while appreciating what already fits well in the space.

Once that’s clear, the next step involves gathering inspiration. Browsing through platforms like Pinterest or Instagram helps to visualize different ideas and identify what aesthetic or setup truly matches the mood I’m going for. In this part, I would already start to picture in my head how everything could come. I’d think about the mood and art I want to create, not just the look.

All references, screenshots, and saved ideas would then be collected and organized in one place, probably an app like Canva. I would create a visual mood board that helps plan out the color palette, furniture styles, and decorative elements. I find this method and tool very helpful to separate different visions for the room. 

The next step is to move everything out of the room. The interior needs to be empty so I can really think about the vision and staff I would like to put in here. With the vision clear, the next phase would be analyzing the room practically: measuring the space, checking natural light, and listing current items worth keeping. This helps in deciding what needs to be bought or replaced. 

When it comes to choosing furniture, I like to start with the main pieces — the ones that define the space and set the tone for everything else. In my case, the first pick would definitely be a wooden bed with natural materials, in a calming and non-distracting color. Right after that, I’d focus on selecting the wardrobe, since it's a large and functional piece that I need in a tonal shade to blend with the walls. Once those key elements are chosen, the rest of the room like shelving, lighting, textiles, small furniture and accessories would be built slowly and intentionally around them.

Although I don’t currently know how to design or visualize a space using digital tools, I would love to learn how to do it. That would be a really helpful skill to add to this process, and it would make it easier to see if my ideas work well together before making any final decisions.

At this point, I would also look for someone who could help me with the renovation itself. Even though I’d like to be involved in the whole process, there are parts where support would be helpful, especially when it comes to moving heavy furniture or assembling larger elements. However, when it comes to painting the walls, I’d prefer to do it myself. It is not something that has to be perfect and such imperfections give a little bit of soul to the room.

I would also start searching for furniture in my favorite store, mostly online, because I’m not a fan of shopping locally. I like taking my time with these decisions, looking for pieces that not only match the style I have in mind but are also practical and long-lasting. I’d focus on making thoughtful choices, not rushing anything, and building the space step by step until everything feels right.
