The plan starts by walking around the room and calmly assessing what works and what could be improved. 
It’s not about rushing to get rid of things, but about understanding what still fits and what needs change.
Next, I gather inspiration from platforms like Pinterest or Instagram, focusing not just on looks but on the mood I want to create. 
I collect ideas into one place, like Canva, and build a visual mood board.
Then I’d empty the room to better visualize the new layout. I’d measure the space, check natural light, and note what’s worth keeping. 
Key furniture like a bed or wardrobe comes first. Other elements are added slowly to fit their style.
I’d love to learn digital tools to visualize the design better, it would make the renovation much easier.
I’d seek help for the heavy work but prefer to paint the walls myself — small flaws add character.
I’d shop most of my things online taking my time and after everything is done I would assemble the furniture.
