The plan starts by walking around the room and calmly assessing what works and what could be improved. 
It’s not about rushing to get rid of things, but about understanding what still fits and what needs change.
Next, I gather inspiration from platforms like Pinterest or Instagram, focusing not just on looks but on the mood I want to create. 
I collect ideas into one place, like Canva, and build a visual mood board to define colors, furniture, and style.
Then I’d empty the room to better visualize the new layout. I’d measure the space, check natural light, and note what’s worth keeping. 
Key furniture comes first – a wooden bed in calm tones and a wardrobe blending with the walls. Other elements like lighting, shelves, and decor come slowly and intentionally.
I’d love to learn digital tools to visualize the design better. I’d also seek help for the heavy work but prefer to paint the walls myself — small flaws add character.
I shop mostly online, taking time to find pieces that match both my style and needs.
